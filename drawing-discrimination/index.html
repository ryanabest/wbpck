These maps would help determine who could get a mortgage and where properties were deemed valuable for decades to come. In a process that later became known as 'redlining', appraisers primarily used race to determine how valuable or risky housing was in a neighborhood — non-white or immigrant communities were officially treated as 'hazardous' influences to real estate&nbsp;value.</p><p>For my thesis project as a student in the Data Visualzation MS program at the Parsons School of Design, I explored how housing discrimination shaped who was able to build wealth in housing in the past century. To do this, I tracked changes in the racial composition and real estate markets of neighborhoods within New York City redlining maps in the decades after they were drawn. I then looked at individual neighborhood case studies of communities with similar racial compositions or homeownership markets in 1940, connected these communities to the redlining gradings they received at that time, and followed their changing and diverging housing markets through 2010. I also open up the map for exploration, allowing users to study the redlining map of New York in more detail or investigate potential threads of housing discrimination themselves.</p><div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KaL8bF-1SSM?start=5324" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><a class="see-link underline" href="https://parsons.nyc/thesis-2019/">See all 2019 Parsons Data Visualization Theses →</a></p></div><div class="project-content"><h1>Process</h1><div class="swiper-container"><div class="swiper-wrapper"><div class="swiper-slide"><img src="../assets/process1.f3f9a10dc0e206ba8881.png"><p class="process-text">My <a class="underline" href="https://ryanabest.com/ms2-2019/wireframe/">first wireframe mock-up</a> for this project expanded on my <a class="underline" href="../NYCRedliningPoster/">NYC Redlining Poster</a> project, introducing redlining through maps with individual neighborhoods represented as&nbsp;dots...</p></div><div class="swiper-slide"><img src="../assets/process2.755fef6e21df7009ff3b.png"><p class="process-text">...which I would then bring off the map into a <a class="underline" href="https://www.gapminder.org/tools/">Gap Minder</a> inspired scatterplot that displayed insights for the racial composition, homeownership, and home value across the city as&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole.</p></div><div class="swiper-slide"><img src="../assets/process3.ad40b956ba5589654dc9.png"><p class="process-text">I then wanted to show individual neighborhood comparisons without any geospatial representation, showing how the housing markets and racial compositions progressed over&nbsp;time.</p></div><div class="swiper-slide"><img src="../assets/process4.d92bdaa52e54935313d7.png"><p class="process-text">I decided to keep the map alongside neighborhood comparisons in my <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/ryanabest/ms2-2019/raw/master/wireframe/revamped%20wireframe.pdf">next wireframe</a> – I found myself really wanting to see the map in any sketches or concept designs I did of these&nbsp;comparisons.</p></div><div class="swiper-slide"><img src="../assets/process5.9ba30ac5e0c22d86a9ce.png"><p class="process-text">I also wanted to add some qualitative assets that gave us a personal context – I ended up going with photos of individual buildings in each neighborhood over time while keeping the map in the&nbsp;view.</p></div><div class="swiper-slide"><img src="../assets/process6.3377478616e4635dea7d.png"><p class="process-text">I also knew I needed a way for users themselves to explore the map, allowing them to pan, zoom, and see census results for individual neighborhoods they cared&nbsp;about.</p></div><div class="swiper-slide"><img src="../assets/visualization4.b8a5f096ae16c0b72aa0.png"><p class="process-text">The final neighborhood comparison view ended up looking like a cleaned-up version of my last wireframe sketch, with more screen space given to the spark lines and clearer emphasis on the map.</p></div></div><div class="swiper-pagination"></div><div class="swiper-button-prev"></div><div class="swiper-button-next"></div></div><p><strong>Data Source: </strong>Redlining maps from <a class="underline" href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/">Mapping Inequality</a> project / Census data from <a class="underline" href="https://www.nhgis.org/">IPUMS NGHIS</a> / Building images from <a class="underline" href="http://nycma.lunaimaging.com/luna/servlet">NYC Municipal Archives</a> and <a class="underline" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro">Google Street View Static&nbsp;API</a></p><p><strong>Tools: </strong>CSS / d3 / HTML / JavaScript / <a class="underline" href="https://juxtapose.knightlab.com/">JuxtaposeJS</a> / Node / <a class="underline" href="https://gdal.org/programs/ogr2ogr.html">ogr2ogr</a> / Pandas / Python / <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama">Scrollama</a> / <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/">Shapely</a> / Sketch</p><p><a class="see-link underline" href="https://github.com/ryanabest/ms2-2019/tree/master/thesis">See the code →</a></p></div><div class="project-content"><h1>Data</h1><p>There were two main data sources in this project: redlining maps from the <a class="underline" href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/">Mapping Inequality</a> project and 1940-2010 census data from <a class="underline" href="https://www.nhgis.org/">IPUMS NGHIS</a>. I downloaded redlining maps in GeoJSON format for all five New York boroughs and lower Westchester county, which included boundaries and redlining grades for each neighborhood in that map. I then pulled census tracts (as shapefiles) and metrics (as csv files) on percent white/non-white, homeownership rates, and median home values for census tracts within New York from 1940&nbsp;to&nbsp;2010.</p><p>The biggest data challenge in this project was joining census tract data to redlining neighborhoods. These are two distinct geographic boundaries, with census tracts changing decade to decade. Ultimately, what I needed for this analysis was census estimates of racial compisition, homeownership rates, and median home value metrics for each redlining neighborhood in every census&nbsp;decade.</p><p>I approached this problem using spatial geomoetric analysis, leveraging the <a class="underline" href="https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/">Shapely</a> python library. I used this library to figure out which census tract boundaries intersected each redlining neighborhood, logging the geographic area of the overlap. I then estimated census metrics for each neighborhood by averaging results across the tracts that intersected with that neighborhood, with each tract weighted by the proportion of the neighborhood it&nbsp;covers.</p><p>After this lengthy and complicated process, I exported a <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/ryanabest/ms2-2019/blob/master/thesis/data/HOLC_All_Years.geojson">GeoJSON file</a> with census estimates for each redlining neighborhood for every decade from 1940 to 2010, along with all the information originally included from the Mapping Inequality&nbsp;project:<img src="../assets/data1.cdb6ea99a8639a25f671.png"></p><p>For more detail on this data and methodology, feel free to look at the <i>Data and Methodology</i> section of the <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/ryanabest/ms2-2019/raw/master/writing/thesis/thesis.pdf">full thesis write-up</a> for this project.</p></div><div class="project-content"><h1>Visualization</h1><p>The visualizations for this project had two main contexts: <i>geographic</i>, showing the redlining map, and <i>abstract</i>, showing sparklines for census metrics over time.
